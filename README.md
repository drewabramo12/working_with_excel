# Module 1: Kickstarter

Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project was to analyze data from the kickstarter_analysis.xlsx file to determine possible best fit for creating a successful kickstarter campaign for theater plays. The data I was interested in looking into was for two different relationships within the data. The first was the relationship between the month a kickstarter campaign began and the historical outcome for those projects. This could hopefully show when is the best time in the year to start a kickstarter campaign for plays. The second relationship of interest was the percentage of plays that succeeded, failed, or were canceled based on initial goal of the kickstarter campaign. This would help to understand what would be an appropriate goal ask for a play budget going into a kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### Analysis

##### Data

The way that the data was analyzed to determine outcomes based on start date was by creating a pivot chart of worksheet 'kickstarter'. The Filters for this chart were 'Parent Category' and 'Years. The Columns were set to 'outcomes' The Rows were set to 'Date Created Conversion' and the Values were set to 'Count of outcomes'. The data was also filtered to only depict the parent category value of 'theater'. The columns were filtered to remove 'live' theater kickstartes so that the only values that were left were 'successful', 'failed' and 'canceled'. The columns were also sorted into descending order based count of outcomes. The rows were organized from date created conversion into months.

##### Graph

The graph was created by using the data in the created pivot table. The graph was then copied and pasted into the microsoft paint application. The picture was then saved as 'Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png before being uploaded to GitHub with the rest of the files. 

#### Challenge

The challenges that I ran into with creating this analysis were mostly adjusting to the novelty of new systems for myself. I had trouble with finding how to first change the row value to months. This was eventually found to be changed through group selection button on the top of the screen with the help of a hint within the instructions of the deliverable. I also had to go back through the work to determine why my data columns were not organized in the same way as the expected result. It took some fiddling with the filter prompt at the top of the column to figure that out. The last challenge of note for this deliverable was determining that the scaling of the graph for size needed to be done within the excel sheet. If the scale was changed in after converting to the paint application then the image became grainy.
