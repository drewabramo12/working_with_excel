# Module 1: Kickstarter

Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project was to analyze data from the kickstarter_analysis.xlsx file. The data in I was interested in looking into was two different relationships within the data. The first was the relationship between the month a kickstarter campaign began and the historical outcome for those projects. The second relationship of interest was the percentage of plays that succeeded, failed, or were canceled based on initial goal of the kickstarter campaign.
